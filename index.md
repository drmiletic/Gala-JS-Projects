# What is Galascript Projects?

Galascript Projects is a website dedicated to my JS learning journey. Its sole purpose is to host and showcase my JS projects. 

## Simple JS Calculator
My first project is [Simple JS Calculator](https://drmiletic.github.io/Gala-JS-Projects/simple-calculator.html).
Its task is to make calculations with two integers using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS (no libraries or frameworks). 
The solution is based on the CSS grid system. 
The work is still in progress.
