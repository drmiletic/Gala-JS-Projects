# Gala's JS projects

This website is dedicated to my JS learning journey. It's sole purpose is to host and showcase my JS projects. 

The first one is [Simple JS Calculator](https://github.com/drmiletic/Simple-JS-Calculator/blob/master/simple-calculator.html).
Its task is to make calculations with two integers using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS (no libraries or frameworks). 
The solution is based on the CSS grid system. 
The work is still in progress.
